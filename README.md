#### FlatDango-code-challenge
## **By Cherono Mercy 18/10/2023**
#### Project Description
For this challenge, I was working on FlatDango, a Flatiron Movie Theater 
I was using a local API and building out the front end for the app, FlatDango.
    
#### Core Deliverables
As a user, I can:
1. See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads.
   The number of available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`.
   You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:
2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films` element when the page loads.
3. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button.
   I should see the number of available tickets decreasing on the front end.
   I should not be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets available). **No persistence is needed for this feature**.
